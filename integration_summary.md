# Jersey Weather Integration Summary

## Overview

The Jersey Weather integration connects Home Assistant to the Jersey Met weather service API, providing comprehensive weather data for Jersey, Channel Islands. This integration offers current conditions, forecasts, tide information, and weather imagery.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: Temperature, wind speed/direction, and weather conditions
- **Weather Forecast**: 5-day forecast with high/low temperatures and precipitation probability
- **UV Index**: Daily UV index data
- **Tide Information**: High and low tide times and heights
- **Weather Images**: Radar, satellite, and sea state images
- **Sunrise/Sunset**: Daily sunrise and sunset times

## Implementation Details

### Data Coordinator

The integration uses Home Assistant's `DataUpdateCoordinator` to efficiently fetch and refresh data from the Jersey Weather API. The coordinator:

- Fetches data from all API endpoints
- Updates data every 30 minutes
- Provides cached data to all entities
- Handles error cases and retries

### Sensor Platform

The sensor platform creates multiple sensors for various weather data points:

- Current temperature
- Wind direction and speed
- UV index
- Weather condition
- Sunrise and sunset times
- Tide information (high/low tides)

### Weather Platform

The weather platform implements Home Assistant's weather integration, providing:

- Current conditions
- 5-day forecast
- Weather icons and conditions
- Temperature and wind data

### Camera Platform

The camera platform provides visual weather data:

- Radar image
- Satellite image
- Wind waves image
- Sea state images (AM and PM)

## API Information

The integration uses several API endpoints from the Jersey Met service:

- `https://prodgojweatherstorage.blob.core.windows.net/data/jerseyForecast.json` - Weather forecast
- `https://prodgojweatherstorage.blob.core.windows.net/data/JerseyTide5Day.json` - Tide information
- Various image endpoints under `https://sojpublicdata.blob.core.windows.net/jerseymet/`

The API is publicly accessible and doesn't require authentication.

## Usage

After installation, the integration can be configured through the Home Assistant UI. All entities are automatically created and updated. Users can add entities to their dashboard using any of the standard Home Assistant cards.

## Development Notes

- The API is based on reverse engineering the Jersey Weather website
- Data structures may change if the source API is updated
- The integration handles common error cases and timeouts
- All entities are organized under a single device for better organization

## Next Steps for Enhancement

Future enhancement opportunities:

1. Add support for historical data (if available via the API)
2. Create more specialized sensors for specific weather data
3. Create custom cards for more visual representation
4. Add unit conversions for different measurement systems
5. Improve tide predictions and alerts
6. Implement more detailed error handling and status reporting
7. Add support for additional weather services in Jersey or nearby areas

## Installation and Configuration
